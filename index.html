    <h2>A designer...</h2>
    <hr>
        <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h2>...is first and foremost, a human being.</h2>
        <p>Everything that you do is part of a social contract, and it is your duty as a designer to make a positive imprint on the world with everything that you do. Money and class are good, yes, but they should never be the only reasons to do something. Likewise, never do any harm.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h2>...is responsible for the work they put into the world.</h2>
            <p><strong>YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WORK YOU PUT INTO THE WORLD</strong>. I emphasize this because whatever you do, you leave a legacy. It does not matter if you're as transcendent as Muhammad Ali, or someone who lives small, you have a reputation to uphold. If you create something that is knowingly harmful, you have betrayed everyone's trust, even if you didn't realize how harmful it would be.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h2>...values impact over form.</h2>
            <p>This is why "creative" is an eight-letter word in web design. If you have a sparkling, gorgeous looking front end, but a rotten back end, what good does it do? This also bleeds over to the second point: anything designed to cause injury is not well-designed at all.</p>
        </div>
        </div>
    <hr>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h2>...owes the people who hire them their labor AND counsel.</h2>
        <p>Your labor, impressive as it may be, is not enough. You must be so knowledgeable about what you're creating to the point where you can easily recall it like you would your favorite song. Likewise, everything has to be considered: what can go wrong? What is our weak point? If you can't take out a readily-seen weak point, then stop the entire process.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h2>...welcomes criticism.</h2>
            <p>Naturally, this is one of the hardest ones for us as humans to swallow because we always hate to see our labors of love get raked over the coals. However, when we say criticism, we mean <strong>constructive</strong>. When done in an appropriate manner, criticism always, always, always helps you. Saying "this sucks" is terrible enough, but it's even worse when you don't say <em>why</em> it does. Avoid it. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h2>...strives to know their audience.</h2>
            <p>Just like how football coaches need to know the skillsets of their players, we need to fully understand what our audience wants. If your defensive players are well-versed playing in a 3-4 defense, why change to a 4-3? Likewise, if you want to know how a hardcore, analytics-driven football fan would use a site devoted to fantasy football, ask one, or put one on your team.</p>
        </div>
        </div>
    <hr>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h2>...does NOT believe in edge cases.</h2>
        <p>Even if you may not believe it, your outreach still goes beyond your target audience. Not only that, but labeling people as "edge cases" has real life consequences: for example, as a personal case, despite being 1% of the population, asexuals face invalidation, discrimination, and correction.. even from the LGBTQ+ community itself. We still have a duty to uphold to <strong>everyone</strong>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h2>...is part of a <strong>professional</strong> community.</h2>
            <p>No matter if you're a novice or a hardened expert, we share the same community, and your demeanor affects everyone inside it. This goes back to your personal responsibilities: do not leave a mess for the next person to clean up. You're grown.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h2>...welcomes a diverse, competitive field.</h2>
            <p>If we never step out of our comfort zone, we will stagnate. Our line of work will stagnate. We need diversity; we need to hear from and make room for marginalized people because it will make everything about us better: our work, behavior, worldview, and even social skills.</p>
        </div>
        </div>
    <hr>
        <div class="row">
    <div class="col-lg-10">
        <h1>, and most importantly...</h1>
            <h2>...takes time for self-reflection.</h2>
        <p>I have another personal story about this. Before I studied IT, I worked at a call center under the Scotts umbrella, which includes Roundup. Roundup, as you may have heard, has come under heavy fire for including glyphosate in its formula, which has been linked to cancer. I did not feel comfortable toeing the company line about how overblown they thought the risks were, and that was one of the reasons why I left in June 2018. The point is: reflect on what you're bringing into this world periodically. If you can feel yourself betraying your duties as a designer (or a human in general), fix them.</p>
